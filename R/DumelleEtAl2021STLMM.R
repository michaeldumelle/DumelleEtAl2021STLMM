#' DumelleEtAl2021STLMM: Fit Spatio-Temporal Linear Mixed Models
#'
#' A Supplementary R Package to to "A Linear Mixed Model Formulation for
#'   Spatio-Temporal Random Processes with Computational Advances for the
#'   Product, Sum, and Product-Sum Covariances." The funtions most often
#'   used are \code{stlmm()} for fitting spatio-temporal linear mixed
#'   models, \code{summary()} for summarizing those models, and \code{predict}
#'   for making predictions.
